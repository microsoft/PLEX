Some of the code in the PLEX codebase is based on the ["gym" part of the Decision Transformer repository](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer/tree/master/gym), released under the [MIT License](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer/blob/master/LICENSE.md). In particular, PLEX/models/trajectory_models/decision\_transformer.py is minimally modified from the original [decision\_transformer.py](https://github.com/kzl/decision-transformer/blob/master/gym/decision_transformer/models/decision_transformer.py).
